Overview of Idea:<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who attends University of Hawaii at Manoa knows of, or has experienced first-hand the difficulties of parking as an underclassman.  The number of available spaces in the parking structure are limited and if a student does not have a semester pass, they will have to pay $5, if the lot is not full by the time they get there.  My solution to this problem plaguing the community of UH Manoa is to create a crowd sourcing parking solution where people an business can offer unused driveway spaces, unused parking lot spaces, or even allow people to park in their yards if they wish to students in need.<hr/>
Page Ideas:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page:  The landing page will introduce the problem and allow users to sign up.</li>
  <li>Sign Up Page:  A secondary sign up page in case the user first explores the site instead of signing up on the home page.</li>
  <li>Member Page:  Regsitered users will have a page where they can see and edit their personal information, view their spaces and account information, and list new spaces.<li/>
  <li>View Available Spaces Page:  This page will allow users to find spaces in their desired location</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
Use Cases:<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two classes of usage.  Buyer and Seller.  The buyer will be able to explore the available locations and rent a spot that they desire.  The seller will be able to put their spots up for rental.  They will be able to either rent them long term, in which case they can set their own price, or they can rent them short term, which will be determined by the application to prevent price gouging.  Sellers could be a homeowner, or a business location like a church or even a parking lot that wants to rent some of their spaces long term.<hr>
Beyond the Basics:<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, the page would be linked to a searchable map that will show all available spaces with a proximity to the user or their desired location.  The application will automatically update when new spaces become available or become unavailable.  Sellers can limit the size of the vehicles that are allowed to park in their spaces, and set the hours that renters can stay.
