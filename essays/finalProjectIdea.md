Overview of Idea:
  Anyone who attends University of Hawaii at Manoa knows of, or has experienced first-hand the difficulties of parking as an underclassman.  The number of available spaces in the parking structure are limited and if a student does not have a semester pass, they will have to pay $5, if the lot is not full by the time they get there.  My solution to this problem plaguing the community of UH Manoa is to create a crowd sourcing parking solution where people an business can offer unused driveway spaces, unused parking lot spaces, or even allow people to park in their yards if they wish to students in need.
