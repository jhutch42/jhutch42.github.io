summary: A website I designed for Morningside Waterports in Miami, FL
---

<img class="ui image" src="../images/msw.PNG">

Morningside Watersports is a watersports company based in Miami Florida.  I designed this website for them in 2016.  I wrote all of the css and HTML code for this website.

I created this site with a combination of responsive code and strictly mobile code.  Since this project I have moved to a completely responsive design.  Still, I created this entire site without the use of a template and used it as a learning experience.  I improved greatly in my CSS skills throughout the development process.
